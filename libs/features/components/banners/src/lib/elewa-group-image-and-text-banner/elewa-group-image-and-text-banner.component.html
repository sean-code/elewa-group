        <h1>Beyond business</h1>
        <p>Some of that youthful energy is channeled beyond<br>
            business. Through projects such as our coding school<br>
            in Kakuma. refugee camp, training teacher in pastoral<br>
            Samburu and our open-source coding initiatives<br>
            providing entry-level opportunities to hundreds of<br>
            junior engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
            These projects don't necessarily have an immediate<br>
            financial return, but their impact can be tangibly <br>
            measured in the long-term.
